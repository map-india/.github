## The Museum
MAP is situated in the heart of the city of Bengaluru, India on Kasturba Road, within an easy walking-distance of Cubbon Park, MG Road and Vidhana Soudha metro stations. The architectural framework of the museum echoes functionality and a sense of openness. Divided into five-storeys, the museum includes art galleries, an auditorium, an art and research library, an education centre, a specialised research and conservation facility, a cafe, member’s lounge and fine-dining restaurant.

## Focus on Accessibility
Designed by Mathew & Ghosh, the building features a strong focus on accessibility, to support visitors with special needs and disabilities. Designed with steel panels that are embossed with a cross pattern, the facade of the building resembles an industrial water tank, which is meant to bring out the metaphorical connection between the idea of storing something precious: in this case, art. The simple and unique design, material, transparency, and opacity of the building make it an architectural icon in the city of Bengaluru.

The designing and execution was carried out under the close guidance of the MAP Architectural Committee, led by Rahul Mehrotra of RMA Architects, and with Mahrukh Tarapore and the late Martand Singh as its core members.

## Our Mission

The Museum’s mission is to democratise art, making it as fun and relatable to everyone as possible!
We hope to change the perception of museums and art by making our museum a melting pot of ideas, stories and cultural exchange.  Ultimately, we want to inspire people to interact with art in ways that encourage humanity, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the world we live in.
